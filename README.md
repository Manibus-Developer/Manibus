# Manibus

## A single-chip bridge  
 
This is a software system that can directly control the MCU through the computer. The MCU does not need to write the corresponding hardware driver, and directly controls the MCU to drive the hardware in the way of communication.   

## Communication method  

The computer program controls the single-chip microcomputer by serial port, Bluetooth, WIFI, USB, TCP, etc. The method can also be related to hardware. For example, the electronic module of WIFI to serial port to the single chip can also be used.  


## Our expectations  

We hope that everyone can find a simple way between the upper computer and the lower computer control, to avoid writing the lower computer program and communication protocol every time. This is often encountered in our embedded work, and we think that Manibus will be a very good open source protocol. It can be used in the fields of instrument control, robot control, automation equipment, and teaching equipment.
